# Hazard-of-Smartphone

# üìò Introduction
In the current digital era, smartphones have become an integral part of daily life, particularly for teenagers. While they offer numerous advantages, the increasing concern over excessive smartphone use among adolescents stems from its potential negative impacts on their well-being.

This project delves into the patterns and consequences of smartphone usage among teenagers, with a specific focus on its relationship with addiction levels. By analyzing comprehensive survey data, we aim to uncover how various smartphone habits correlate with critical aspects of adolescent life, including sleep quality, academic performance, and mental health.

# üéØ Objectives
This research project seeks to achieve the following objectives:

Explore the relationship between smartphone usage and addiction levels: Investigate whether increased phone usage directly correlates with higher levels of addiction among teenagers.

Identify hidden groups of users with similar behaviors: Utilize K-Means clustering to segment teenagers into distinct groups based on their smartphone habits and related lifestyle factors. This will help in identifying high-risk profiles.

Analyze the impact of lifestyle factors on addiction: Examine how variables such as sleep patterns, gaming time, and academic engagement influence smartphone addiction levels.

Provide data-driven insights for intervention: Offer a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted impact of smartphone use on teens' daily lives, informing potential strategies for promoting healthier digital habits.

This project leverages techniques such as correlation analysis and K-Means clustering to achieve its objectives. Understanding these patterns is crucial as excessive phone use among teenagers has been linked to sleep problems, lower academic performance, anxiety, and other mental health challenges.
